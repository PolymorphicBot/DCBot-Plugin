Was that just a general criticism of my logic, or do you really want no part of it?
This is a problem that they have.

I need to play the piano
no
no guys
oh
ragtime
the easter wolves
the easter wolves need to be rivals with the normal hedgehogs
they are throwing food
this is actually my fursona
this is like Wreck It Ralph but for food
what is this 
damn
hey robo, do me a solid and pop into the nether real fast
if you've got 4 blocks worth we're golden
I just mined netherquartz
I'll keep looking around.
I need to know where the portal is
I think we went in circles
no oxygen
oh, if you're leaving the nether tell me portal co-ords
okay, so now we try to aim for space
remember, hollow middle so it's 34 blocks.
..r...robo?
so you need glowstone yeah
to avoid drug references
warpaport me cap'n
we'll need plenty of glowstone for space by the way
wither skeleton was inside an invisible pigman
with full scale armor we could swim in the lava...
yes please
after flying around
and miss
as rare as normal slimes
but in the nether
but its gone
found one
found the spawner of blazes
good
hold on
I can get us out
I have a stack
I'm looking for a fort
I thought minecraft the heglehug was cool
its just ores
look at that
magma slimes are like
my new indie band
nasa should develop glowstone
nether ores aren't worth it though
no seriously
oh nether ores still explode :o
oh we need blaze powder
okay, got another stack's worth of glown
or whatever?
silverfish in the nether
so far
thanks sega
the achievement for getting a blaze rod isn't blaze it
the first room of the nether is safe
the fuck
the nether is spooky
what the fuck nintendo
where
why isn't it called blaze it
wither skeliton
woah
yeah, mining nether ores does that
agggggggggh
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the infinite text thing again
and i'm unfamiliar with mekanisms bullshit
because there are holes
but yeah, look
come on you stupid stirling thing fucking work
hold on, gotta eat.
it has three fucking engines on it and i cleared all the blocks in the middle stopping it
it's working now
it was doing a thing
just in tropics
like a miniravine
lots of diamonds
mkay
okay why isn't it going?
quarry time then
thanks
that is point blank fucking stupid
the fuck happened here
there's just a portion of the world that's fallen downthis is just so dumb.
thought a volcano happened
why is it not working?!
wonder if this has any unique ores
working on the quarry setup
yay
yeah but it needs osmium stuff
yes
after the water thing
all of this
and there was nothing under it
but an obsidian sword does 14
hi sbnkalny
holy shit
i know it has at least one
it is a jewel
oh this
oops
or whatever
railcraft maybe
that can be used to make bamboo tools
the engines are rewarming up
the hobbyist engines are from another mod even
the spear does 8 damage
they are from steve's carts
uh, i dug a sand
where as a diamond sword does 7
with jewels
a couple people, i think
actually, looking at it, there are blocks on two sides
ah, okay
and keep themselves from drowning
and some on the bottom
and then i just took the spreadsheet and wrote a script to convert it into code
as long as they have a gristwidget, at least
because of the gristwidget, it really is a lot like alchemy or whatever
but do you have any dirt?
but when it teleports it goes block by block from one side to the other
bye
converting one thing into another thing
different amounts, though
dirt is pretty cheap
equivalent
haha
hmm
hmm?
how come?
huh
i can fix this bug pretty easily
i'd say it's a problem with mcpc+ (the server this is using)
if you have a bed you should sleep in it
i just changed the time
i messed up the landing platforms of those portals, though
i'm pretty sure it does
i seriously have no idea
i should fix that
i think i just figured it out
i think you put an uncarved dowel in the alchemiter
it looks like it copied a bit of it and then just made the rest of it air
it should
it tried teleporting the area twice
it would only be caused by players, though
i usually enter the medium from underground
just walk around
maybe?
maybe, yeah
nah
nah i'll leave the end
nah, just one kind of boondollar
nah, that one should work just fine
nah, that shouldn't be an issue
nah, the transfer is server side
nope, it had no error
nothing atm
now they don't get created for some reason
oh, i really need to make the nakagators use the new model
okay
or i could add boondollars, i guess
pigs wouldn't cause an issue, or any other entity
probably
since i'm not in my own land
sleep in it anyway
something must have drowned
sorry about destroying your house and stuff, though
stone costs the same, which seems a bit odd to me, honestly
sure
that shouldn't be possible
they won't for me
this is the land of pulse and shade, apparently
this is totally illogical, huh
unless the teleportation code was messed with by someone
wait what
what do you mean?
what happened seems impossible
yeah
yeah, i do
yeah, i noticed
yeah, like karkat's land
you're welcome
your house really is gone
your land
0_0
1000 build grist
1 grist
a big monster is staring at meeee
alchemize
almost died
and build grist
and take the land too
and the computer is facing the wrong way...
and the ladders are gone
arrrgh
at the cost of things like grist
but i have saplings
cannot sleep
cya
dark
different monsters, different boondollars?
exactly
(except monsters)
found grist at the botton of an oilfall
...fuck
hehehehe
hey
hm
home sweet home
how to make the perfect generic object
i cannot determine the time...!
if you eat a artifact here
if you put in a really damaged helmet
i gtg
i have lots of cruxite
i'll be back in 2 hours
i'm done strifing
i'm going
i need to transmute string for it
irl
i shall not give up myself for my house
it's lunch for me..
it's neat
it's not night
it's ok i can make some if i want
just 21 blocks tho
just one problem
killed the basilisk
ladders
lagtest
lets go strifing
lolz
lolz...
made a bet
maybe they can sell potions and weapons in future?
my teacher is here
nooooo
no, right
normal world portal!!!
not going
nothing really in the plains
now i can't get up
no wood
obsidian?
oh...
oh god i cannot exit
oil falls
ok
or do we need another bed
people can just repair their stuffs
pulse?
*ragemode*
reminds me of null session
*shrug*
so now it sets spawnpoint here?
so yeah
so you like my house?
strife!
strife specibus: stoweswordkind
strifing time
thankfully yes
thats what i meant
that too
there it is
they don't give loot
they make great food
they're just floating
this place
this place is great
to craft stairs i have to get up
to get up i have to craft stairs
took me two days
uh oh
wait does it
wanna come
want artifacts?
weird
weird, some blocks disappeared
what can you do with uranium
what do these guys do
what's this?
wheee
where are we?
where's home
whoa
who made these costs :/
will you get the same amount of rust as a undamaged helmet?
woo
...woops
...woops?
woot
would it teleport you to your land
yep
yo
you're right
i know
the land of water and i don't know right now
um
basically it copies the whole area to the land, deleting from the origin as it copies it
but the stuff is duplicated to the destination chest and the stuff that fell out is destroyed
is that stuff gone now?
it should have vanished as soon as your house was done teleporting
not unless you are severely hurt
okay, i found 5sammy100's house in the medium
since when the chest is broken in order to teleport, it drops all the stuff
yeah, it breaks everything when it teleports
cool
how should i change it to look more official?
but when i did that
it glitched me and pushed me back out
woops...
an irc bot
hehe
hi
hmm, it looks like it's possible to make a hammer, sledgehammer, and pogohammer in survival
hmm, that could make sense
i'm guessing you found a place where i used a gate portal to get back
in my land, killing underlings
i really need to make it easier to get back from the medium
it's unlikely that you'd find the irc without being told what it is
i've made it so i can see all irc users in the tab player list in minecraft
nope
oh, btw, there's a server map now
only underlings drop grist
on this server it works, but that's probably because the server uses mcpc+
probably, yeah
sbnkalny combines things that have been said, basically
sbnkalny, you should really format your messages better
that gate portal leads to my land, btw
there aren't any meteors, but the cruxite artifact takes the surrounding area with you when you
there's no way atm, a lot of alchemization recipes still need to be made
they are prefixed with [irc] though
use it
well dying might work, but that's not a good solution
well, without being able to give yourself a gate portal, there's no way
what was that whoa about?
(which doesn't show up on irc for some reason)
you found the dynmap chat, haha
you said part of that
do you want it?
go
hello
hmmm
how do i make a sickle?
i have two sburb computers
i have two computers
i just can't wait for the dream moons
